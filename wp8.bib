  abstract  = {Extinction coefficients k($\lambda$) for water at 25{\textdegree}C were determined through a broad spectral region by manually smoothing a point by point graph of k($\lambda$) vs wavelength $\lambda$ that was plotted for data obtained from a review of the scientific literature on the optical constants of water. Absorption bands representing k($\lambda$) were postulated where data were not available in the vacuum uv and soft x-ray regions. A subtractive Kramers-Kronig analysis of the combined postulated and smoothed portions of the k($\lambda$) spectrum provided the index of refraction n($\lambda$) for the spectral region 200 nm $\leq$ $\lambda$ $\leq$ 200 $\mu$m.},

  abstract  = {The use of femtosecond lasers requires accurate measurements of the dispersive properties of media. Here we measure the second- and third-order dispersion of water, seawater, and ocular components in the range of660-930 nm using a new method known as multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan. Our direct dispersion measurements of water have the highest precision and accuracy to date. We found that the dispersion for seawater increases proportionally to the concentration of salt. The dispersion of the vitreous humor was found to be close to that of water. The chromatic dispersion of the cornea-lens complex was measured to obtain the full dispersive properties of the eye.},
